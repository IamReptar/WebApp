  <h1>Why is papyrus hated?</h1>
  <h2>by: M 'Kya Williams</h2>
  <p>Papyrus is a font that stands in noteriety. But why? It's evenly shaped, and fun looking
    and reminds me of a place to buy bread. It apparently looks futuristic and also old at the same time.
    I don't actually use papyrus but I am not opposed to it.
